The objective is to\nimprove understanding of solo construction and tune chord changes.\n\n* Lead sheets and solos can be constructed through either\npoint-and-click or using a plain text editor (one is provided,\nbut any editor can be used). Solos or solo fragments can be\nplayed back immediately on the computer, with chord accompaniment.\n\n* It is not necessary that the soloist memorize the solos that are\ncreated in Impro-Visor. Rather the act of constructing solos is\nsupposed to help one get a better understanding of the tune and of\nsolo construction. But one can use some, if not all, of the ideas\nfrom the solos constructed, as many outstanding players have done\nfor generations.\n\n* Impro-Visor also provides a way for the user to create and save\nlicks for later use. Lick creation is helpful in understanding\nhow to construct interesting lines over chord changes.\n\n* When used for transcription, Impro-Visor allows easy mining of\nselected licks from a solo for future reference.\n\n* Impro-Visor uses dynamic menus in the form shown to help one\nchoose notes, cells, idioms, licks, and quotes for use in\nconstructing a solo.\n\n* Musical knowledge about chords, scales, licks, etc. are definable\nby the user, in the form of a vocabulary text file. These items are\ndefined in a single key, and Impro-Visor will transpose them to\nany key.\n\n* Impro-Visor saves solos and other lead sheets as free-form text.\nWe call this leadsheet notation. Although a point-and-click\ninterface is provided, users can optionally enter chords and/or\nmelody in this notation with a standard text editor and have them\ndisplayed as a lead sheet in Impro-Visor. The documentation tells\nhow to create and interpret the notation. The notation also\nprovides slash-chords and polychords.\n\n* The release of Impro-Visor comes with a few leadsheets with\nmelodies, a number of sample solos, transcriptions, and The\nImaginary Book, a large set (over 1600) of chords-only lead\nsheets for standard and jazz tunes."},
