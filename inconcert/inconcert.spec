%description
It's difficult for a band to use MIDI live. It generally requires
that a MIDI click track be fed to the musicians... and the musicians
must conform or be cast out. If there is an error (like a singer
coming in early or the computer having a hitch), there's generally
no means for recovery â€” you are dead.

InConcert is a MIDI-controlled application that allows a musician to
control the tempo and synchronization of a MIDI sequence. It features
a tap tempo to adjust the beat (and synchronize the beat) and the
ability to skip beats or insert beats. It works by controlling the
Jack Audio Connection Kit's transport. InConcert depends on Jack and
ALSA, and therefore only runs on Linux.
