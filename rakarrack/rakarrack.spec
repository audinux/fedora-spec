%description
This app was born after an informal conversation about effects for guitar using GNU/linux.
The major part of this apps are discontinued or simply not have new versions after few
years. Josep Andreu say on the IRC chat 'I can made an app based on the effects set
hiden on code of ZynAddSubFX (by Paul Nasca Octavian)'. Some time after here is the
result of our work...

This app has 42 effects:
  * EQ Lineal
  * Compressor
  * Distortion
  * Overdrive
  * Echo
  * Chorus
  * Phaser
  * Flanger
  * Reverb
  * Parametric EQ
  * Wah Wah
  * Alienwha
  * Harmonizer
  * etc.
The effects are procesed in cascade... The order of effects are configurable by the user.
The state of rack can be saved as 'presets'. Sets of presets can be stored as 'banks'.
The rack also has an integrated tuner and can receive MIDI control orders and can send MIDI
notes to MIDI devices like synthesizers.
