%description
importlib_resources is a backport of Python standard library
importlib.resources module for older Pythons.

The key goal of this module is to replace parts of pkg_resources
with a solution in Python's stdlib that relies on well-defined APIs.
This makes reading resources included in packages easier, with more
stable and consistent semantics.
