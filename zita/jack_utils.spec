%description
jack_fpmon: watch an audio signal for denormals, Nan and Inf samples.

jack_check: watch for discontinuities in Jack's timing info (frametime
   and period start times). This has been quite useful while developing
   zita-njbridge.

jack_proxy: this just copies inputs to outputs. There are some Jack
   clients which autoconnect to the system:playback ports and provide
   no other options. There's little that can be done about those.
   There are some others which at least allow you to specify a client
   to connect to - but not to which ports. They just make a random
   choice and this of course fails completely when the client has
   multiple sets of ports with different functions.
   It is for these that jack-proxy can be handy. Just run a jack_proxy
   with the number of ports you need and connect them to your client(s).
   Then tell the broken app to connect to the proxy.
