%description
CollisionDrive is modeled after the Horizon Devices Precision Drive(*),
a modern overdrive pedal with a built-in noise gate.
Besides the usual Volume and Drive controls, the CollisionDrive features
Attack and Bright controls.
The Attack control manipulates the response of the pedal, turning it down
simultaneously softens the overdrive attack and increases the sustain.
The Bright control gives you even more flexibility. It can add presence
to darker sounding amps, or remove buzzing when needed.
The Gate control sets the noise gate threshold. In the plugin interface,
this control lights up to indicate that the noise gate is active.
